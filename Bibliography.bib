title = {The Case for Recombinant Computing},
abstract = {Interoperability among a group of devices, applications, and services is typically predicated on those entities having some degree of prior knowledge of one another. In particular, they must be written to understand the type of thing with which they will interact, including the details of communication as well as semantic knowledge such as when and how to communicate. This paper presents a case for ``recombinant computing''---a set of common interaction patterns that leverage mobile code to allow rich interactions among computational entities with only limited a priori knowledge of one another. We have been experimenting with a particular embodiment of these ideas, which we call Speakeasy. It is designed to support ad hoc, end user configurations of hardware and software, and provides patterns for data exchange, user control, and contextual awareness.},

title = {The Social Psychology of Creativity},
abstract = {Motivation plays a crucial role in the creative process. It is not enough to have unusually high levels of skill or a deep conceptual understanding. In order for students to reach their creative potential, they must approach a task with intrinsic motivation; they must engage in that task for the sheer pleasure and enjoyment of the activity itself rather than for some external goal. Researchers and theorists now understand that there is a direct relation between the motivational orientation brought to a task and the likelihood of creativity at that task. And it is particular features of the school environment and students' daily routine that in large part determine that motivation. The present paper outlines investigations revealing that the typical classroom is fraught with teaching practices and programme features that kill intrinsic motiv- ation and creativity. Research designed to immunise students against the negative effects of these damaging classroom elements is reviewed. The argument is made that the undermining of intrinsic motivation and creativity of performance may be largely driven by an affective, rather than a cognitive, mechanism, and recent cross-cultural data gathered in a non-western educational setting are reviewed.},

abstract = {Hypermedia structures have been integrated with CSCW functionality to develop the DOLPHIN system, an electronic meeting room environment. In this paper, a study is reported investigating how the DOLPHIN environment affects group work. Different aspects of group problem solving were examined to understand the effects of working with hypermedia: the group's product, cognitive factors, and the group process. The results showed that groups can easily work with hypermedia structures, and that these structures influence groups to produce a different product, to use a different strategy, and to use a different collaborative style, namely of dividing up their labor. The experimental results are explained in a model which suggests the involvement of both procedural and semantic components in hypermedia use. We discuss wider implications of hypermedia for CSCW and group work.},

First, human factors issues peculiar to group interaction appear that, if ignored, seriously limit the usability of the group tool. Second, implementation is fraught with considerable hurdles. This paper describes the issues and experiences we have met and handled in the design of two systems supporting remote real time group interaction: GroupSketch, a multi-user sketchpad; and GroupDraw, an object-based multi-user draw package. On the human factors side, we summarize empirically-derived design principles that we believe are critical to building useful and usable collaborative drawing tools. On the implementation side, we describe our experiences with replicated versus centralized architectures, schemes for participant registration, multiple cursors, network requirements, and the structure of the drawing primitives.},

In this pa- per, we propose a method of building computer augmented environments using a situation-aware portable device. This device, called NaviCam, has the ability to recognize the user's situation by detecting color-code IDs in real world environ- ments. It displays situation sensitive information by superim- posing messages on its video see-through screen. Combina- tion of ID-awareness and portable video-see-through display solves several problems with current ubiquitous computers systems and augmented reality systems.},

abstract = {We are investigating how people move from individual to group work through the use of both personal digital assistants (PDAs) and a shared public display. Our scenario of this work covers the following activities. First, mobile individuals can create ``personal'' notes on their PDAs. Second, when individuals meet in real time, they can selectively ``publicize'' notes by moving them to a shared public display. Third, the group can manipulate personal and public items in real time through both PDAs and the shared public display, where the notes contained on both PDAs and public display are automatically synchronized. Finally, people leave a meeting with a common record of their activity. We describe our SharedNotes system that illustrates how people move through this scenario. We also highlight a variety of problematic design issues that result from having different devices and from having the system enforce a rigid distinction between personal and public information.},

title = {Software Infrastructure for Ubiquitous Computing Environments: Supporting Synchronous Collaboration with Heterogeneous Devices},
abstract = {In ubiquitous computing environments, multiple users work with a wide range of different devices. In many cases, users interact and collaborate using multiple heterogeneous devices at the same time. The configuration of the devices should be able to change frequently due to a highly dynamic, flexible and mobile nature of new work practices. This produces new requirements for the architecture of an appropriate software infrastructure. In this paper, an architecture designed to meet these requirements is proposed. To test its applicability, this architecture was used as the basis for the implementation of BEACH, the software infrastructure of i-LAND (the ubiquitous computing environment at GMD-IPSI). It provides the functionality for synchronous cooperation and interaction with roomware components, i.e. room elements with integrated information technology. In conclusion, our experiences with the current implementation are presented.},

title = {Idea Management In a Shared Drawing Tool},
abstract = {The generation of design ideas in group discussion is a complex and dynamic process. Some design ideas are accepted; others are rejected; many others are modified and combined. The fluent expression of ideas and the ability to interact and build on representations created by others contributes significantly to the idea generation process. Computerized shared drawing tools support this fluency and interaction, but such tools need to aid not only the drawing process but also the management of design ideas during group interaction. This paper lays the groundwork for the design of the idea management portion of a shared drawing tool. It presents a taxonomy of group idea management activities, identifies user requirements in support of these behaviours, and illustrates how the user requirements are satisfied by features in CaveDraw, an experimental shared drawing system.},

title = {Issues and Experiences Designing and Implementing Two Group Drawing Tools},
abstract = {Groupware designers are now developing multi-user equivalents of popular paint and draw applications. Their job is not an easy one. First, human factors issues peculiar to group interaction appear that, if ignored, seriously limit the usability of the group tool. Second, implementation is fraught with considerable hurdles. This paper describes the issues and experiences we have met and handled in the design of two systems supporting remote real time group interaction: GroupSketch, a multi-user sketchpad; and GroupDraw, an object-based multi-user draw package. On the human factors side, we summarize empirically-derived design principles that we believe are critical to building useful and usable collaborative drawing tools. On the implementation side, we describe our experiences with replicated versus centralized architectures, schemes for participant registration, multiple cursors, network requirements, and the structure of the drawing primitives.},

	abstract = {For many years, theories of collaborative learning tended to focus on how individuals function in a group. More recently, the focus has shifted so that the group itself has become the unit of analysis. In terms of empirical research, the initial goal was to establish whether and under what circumstances collaborative learning was more effective than learning alone. Researchers controlled several independent variables (size of the group, composition of the group, nature of the task, communication media, and so on). However, these variables interacted with one another in a way that made it almost impossible to establish causal links between the conditions and the effects of collaboration. Hence, empirical studies have more recently started to focus less on establishing parameters for effective collaboration and more on trying to understand the role which such variables play in mediating interaction. In this chapter, we argue that this shift to a more process-oriented account requires new tools for analysing and modelling interactions.},
