abstract = {We-Met (Window	Environment-Meeting Enhancement Tools) is a prototype pen-based tool designed to support both the	communication and information re- trieval needs of stnall group meetings. The first part of this paper describes We-Met and the rationale for its design, the second discusses findings from an empirical study of the use of We-Met for group communication, and the third discusses findings from a study of the search and retrieval of information	from non-computer based meetings conducted to provide insight into how to facilitate these activities in	We-Met. The paper identifies potential	 communication	process gains due to the pen-based interface style, opportunities for the facilitation	of information retrieval in a pen-based tool, and functionality/interface	challenges in the design of a tool to support small group meetings.},

title = {Issues and Experiences Designing and Implementing Two Group Drawing Tools},
abstract = {Groupware designers are now developing multi-user equivalents of popular paint and draw applications. Their job is not an easy one. First, human factors issues peculiar to group interaction appear that, if ignored, seriously limit the usability of the group tool. Second, implementation is fraught with considerable hurdles. This paper describes the issues and experiences we have met and handled in the design of two systems supporting remote real time group interaction: GroupSketch, a multi-user sketchpad; and GroupDraw, an object-based multi-user draw package. On the human factors side, we summarize empirically-derived design principles that we believe are critical to building useful and usable collaborative drawing tools. On the implementation side, we describe our experiences with replicated versus centralized architectures, schemes for participant registration, multiple cursors, network requirements, and the structure of the drawing primitives.},
