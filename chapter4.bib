title = {Collaborative design: what is it?},
abstract = {Collaborative activities are an important application of computer technology now that telecommunications infrastructure has been established to support it. There are many students in schools of architecture who are undertaking collaborative projects using the Internet and many practices who work together exchanging files and interacting on shared digital models. Software vendors are developing tools to support such collaboration. But what are we doing? What is the nature of collaboration and what are the implications for tools that support this work? },

title = {Distances and Diversity: Sources for Social Creativity},
abstract = {The power of the unaided, individual mind is highly overrated: The Renaissance scholar no longer exists. Although creative individuals are often thought of as working in isolation, the role of interaction and collaboration with other individuals is critical to creativity. Creative activity grows out of the relationship between individuals and their work, and from the interactions between an individual and other human beings. Because complex problems require more knowledge than any single person possesses, it is necessary that all involved stakeholders participate, communicate, collaborate, and learn from each other. Distances (across spatial, temporal, and technological dimensions) and diversity (bringing stakeholders together from different cultures) are important sources for social creativity.
This paper describes conceptual frameworks and socio- technical environments (derived from the systems that we have developed over the last decade) in which social creativity can come alive.},

title = {Observations of teamwork and social processes in design},
abstract = {This paper analyses the teamwork experiment of the Delft Protocols Workshop, with particular reference to design activity as a social process. Observations are made on the following aspects: on the roles and relationships within the team, on theirplanning of the design process and their actions relative to that plan, on their gathering and sharing of information, on their ways of analysing and understanding the design
problem, on their ways of developing and adopting design concepts, and on their resolution and avoidance of conflicts. We conclude that the social
process of design interacts significantly with the technical and the cognitive processes of design.},
